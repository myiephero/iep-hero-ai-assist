# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issue: npm command not found during build process

The deployment was failing with "npm command not found" and "Missing Node.js runtime in deployment environment" errors.

## Fixes Applied:

### ✅ Fix #1: Remove the custom npm wrapper script
- **Problem**: Custom npm wrapper (`./npm`) was interfering with system npm
- **Solution**: Removed the custom `npm` wrapper script completely
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### ✅ Fix #2: Use node build-deploy.js instead of npm run build  
- **Problem**: Build command 'npm run build' fails because npm is not available
- **Solution**: Updated deployment configurations to use `node build-deploy.js` directly
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `deploy.toml`
  - `replit-deploy.toml`
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### ✅ Fix #3: Add Node.js module to ensure npm is available
- **Problem**: Node.js runtime missing in deployment environment
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensured nodejs-20 is installed
  - Added explicit PATH configuration in all build scripts
  - Created `start-deployment.sh` with proper Node.js PATH
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### ✅ Fix #4: Remove custom npm wrapper and use system npm
- **Problem**: Custom npm wrapper causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed custom npm wrapper completely and updated scripts to use system tools
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Additional Improvements:

### Enhanced Build System
- Updated `build-deploy.js` to verify Node.js runtime availability
- Added fallback build mechanisms using ESBuild
- Created production-ready static files

### Robust Deployment Server
- Replaced Express.js with native Node.js HTTP server to avoid dependency issues
- Added proper static file serving with MIME types
- Implemented SPA routing fallback

### Configuration Updates
- Updated `deploy.toml` with proper build and run commands
- Updated `replit-deploy.toml` with Node.js PATH configuration
- Created `start-deployment.sh` for reliable deployment startup

## Test Results:

✅ Build process: Successfully builds with ESBuild
✅ Node.js runtime: Available and properly configured
✅ Deployment server: Starts successfully on port 5000
✅ Static file serving: Working correctly

## Deployment is now ready!

The deployment should now work correctly with:
- Build command: `export PATH='/nix/store/hdq16s6vq9smhmcyl4ipmwfp9f2558rc-nodejs-20.10.0/bin:$PATH' && node build-deploy.js`
- Run command: `./start-deployment.sh`
