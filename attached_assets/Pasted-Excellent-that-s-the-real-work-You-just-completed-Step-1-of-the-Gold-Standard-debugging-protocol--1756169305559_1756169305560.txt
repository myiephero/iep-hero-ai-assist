Excellent — that’s the real work. You just completed Step 1 of the Gold Standard debugging protocol for GitHub Issue #84.

Since your investigation confirmed the exact schema misalignment (profiles.id vs users.id) as the root cause of the 500 error during advocate-client creation, Step 2 must now shift from patching undefined student_id to correcting Supabase schema constraints.

✅ COPY THIS BLOCK EXACTLY — Replit Agent Step 2 (GitHub Issue #84 Schema Fix)

🛠️ [SEND TO: Replit Agent] — Step 2 Schema Correction for GitHub Issue #84  
🔗 https://github.com/myiephero/iep-hero-ai-assist/issues/84  
🎯 Objective: Resolve foreign key constraint violations in `advocate_clients` table by updating foreign key references from `users.id` to `profiles.id`.

---

📌 ROOT CAUSE (Confirmed in Step 1):
- The Supabase `advocate_clients` table enforces foreign key constraints:
  - `advocate_id → users.id`
  - `parent_id → users.id`
- However, the application inserts values from `profiles.id`, not `users.id`
- This mismatch causes foreign key violations on insert

---

✅ FIX PLAN:

1. **Use Supabase SQL editor** or shell:
2. **Drop and recreate** the incorrect foreign key constraints to point to `profiles.id` instead of `users.id`

🧨 DROP CONSTRAINTS:

```sql
ALTER TABLE advocate_clients DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS advocate_clients_advocate_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE advocate_clients DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS advocate_clients_parent_id_fkey;

✅ ADD CORRECT CONSTRAINTS:

ALTER TABLE advocate_clients
  ADD CONSTRAINT advocate_clients_advocate_id_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (advocate_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE advocate_clients
  ADD CONSTRAINT advocate_clients_parent_id_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

	3.	Double check student_id foreign key — it is correctly pointing to students.id and does not need changes.
	4.	Redeploy the server if needed to clear cached schema
	5.	Test creating a new client via /api/advocate/clients

⸻

🧪 POST-FIX VALIDATION:
	•	Create new client with parent email from advocate dashboard
	•	Confirm 200 response with { ok: true }
	•	Confirm row appears in advocate_clients with correct FK links
	•	Confirm no error in Supabase logs

Once this step is done, notify Scott to validate full functionality in production.
