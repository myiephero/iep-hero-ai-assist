🔧 **Step 1: Debug missing Supabase session in API routes**  
GitHub Issue: https://github.com/myiephero/iep-hero-ai-assist/issues/79  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
Fix platform-wide Supabase session loss that causes 401/403 errors for parent and advocate POST requests.

---

## 🔍 Context  

After successful login, users are routed to the correct dashboard, but **Supabase sessions are not persisting across API routes**.  

Console logs show:
- `❌ No valid Supabase session found`  
- `❌ Student creation error details: Authentication required`  
- `❌ Error in mutation function: Failed to create advocate-client relationship`  

This suggests `supabase.auth.getSession()` inside API route is returning null or missing headers.

---

## ✅ Fix Plan  

Please do all of the following in one shell command block:

1. **Audit the API route at `/api/parent/students` and `/api/advocate/clients`**:  
   - Log incoming headers (`req.headers`)  
   - Check whether the `Authorization` header with Bearer token is being sent  
   - Confirm `supabase.auth.getUser(req)` or `getServerSession()` is properly used

2. **Verify session persistence**:
   - Ensure `supabase.auth.getSession()` returns a valid session inside API routes
   - Confirm the `Authorization` header is passed correctly from the frontend

3. **Patch Supabase client if needed**:
   - If session is missing, wrap your API handlers with a session hydration utility  
   - Review Supabase middleware or cookie settings if needed (Supabase Edge client, if applicable)

4. **Test fix with advocate and parent accounts**:
   - Test POST `/api/parent/students` using rikka6879@yahoo.com  
   - Test POST `/api/advocate/clients` using erika.levine2017@gmail.com  
   - Verify the record is successfully created in DB  
   - Check that the `owner_id` or `advocate_id` fields are correct (matches `auth.uid()`)

5. ✅ Once confirmed, log:  
   - `[ISSUE-79] Supabase session correctly hydrated in API route`  
   - `[ISSUE-79] POST /api/parent/students passed`  
   - `[ISSUE-79] POST /api/advocate/clients passed`

## 🧠 Reminder  
This bug is now blocking all student/client creation. Session hydration must work identically across:
- Frontend PWA → Supabase client
- API route → Supabase server API client

Deploy only after full local test passes.  
Awaiting confirmation before Step 2.
