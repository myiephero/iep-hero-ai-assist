Understood—if the **“Save to Vault”** button is still not working, even after trying fixes, here’s what’s likely going wrong and how to resolve it.

---

## Why It May Still Be Broken

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies** – If RLS on the `documents` table isn’t configured to allow frontend insertions, all attempts will silently get rejected. You may see no errors, but the insert fails ([GitHub][1]).

2. **Supabase Insert Defaults Returns `select()` Output** – By default, Supabase may attempt to `SELECT` the inserted row after inserting it. If there's no `SELECT` policy for that table, it may fail even if the insert itself is permitted ([Stack Overflow][2]).

### Prompt: Fix “Save to Vault” – Supabase Insert + RLS

The **Save to Vault** button in the Smart Letter Generator still fails on live insert. Please address the following:

1. **Review RLS Policy on `documents` table:**

   * Add an INSERT policy for `authenticated` role.
   * Optionally include a permissive `SELECT` policy.
   * Example:

     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to insert" 
       ON documents FOR INSERT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to select" 
       ON documents FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
     ```
2. **Adjust Insert Logic:**

   * If frontend is chaining `.select()` after `.insert()`, it may violate SELECT RLS. Remove the `.select()` or add `{ returning: "minimal" }` to bypass post-insert select ([Stack Overflow][3], [Stack Overflow][2]).
3. Confirm the button triggers a proper insert:

   * Save `user_id`, `student_id`, `title`, `content`, `timestamp`.
4. Show toast on success or detailed error messages on failure.

Once fixed, test again after authentication and confirm the letter appears in the Document Vault.
