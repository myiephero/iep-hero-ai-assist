### 🐞 Production Bug Report

**Title:** ❌ Tailwind CLI Not Executable in Bun (Build Blocker)

**Severity:** High – Blocks Vercel deployment due to missing CSS output  
**Source Environment:** Replit (Bun runtime)  
**Role Affected:** DevOps / Build System  
**Date:** 2025-08-26  

---

### 🧵 Issue Summary:
Attempting to run the Tailwind CSS build command fails with:

```
error: could not determine executable to run for package tailwindcss  
bash: tailwindcss: command not found
```

This prevents `output.css` from being generated, which halts Vercel deploy. Attempts with `bun add`, `npx`, `bunx`, and direct binary usage have all failed.

---

### 🔁 Current Behavior:
- `bunx tailwindcss` → CLI not found
- `npx tailwindcss` → still fails to resolve binary
- No `dist/output.css` is produced
- Deployment queue blocks due to missing output

---

### ✅ Expected Behavior:
- `bunx tailwindcss` or `npx tailwindcss` should successfully build and minify CSS from `client/index.css` into `dist/output.css`
- Build output should be valid for Vercel deploy
- Tailwind CLI should be available for scripting in Replit shell

---

### 🧪 Steps to Reproduce:
1. Replit Shell:
```bash
bunx tailwindcss -i ./client/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --minify
```
2. Observe:
```
error: could not determine executable to run for package tailwindcss
```

### 🗂️ Related Files:
- `client/index.css`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `package.json`
- Replit Shell + Bun runtime
- No functional `tailwindcss` binary in path

---

### 🧠 Recommended Debug Focus:
- Ensure `tailwindcss` binary is correctly resolved via `bunx`
- Validate that install path is correct and not ESM-only blocked
- If `bunx` fails, switch to `npm` install path with `npx`

---

### ✅ Fix Checklist:
- [ ] Fully remove `tailwindcss` from bun: `bun remove tailwindcss`
- [ ] Reinstall with: `bun add -d tailwindcss`
- [ ] Test CLI: `bunx tailwindcss -i ./client/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --minify`
- [ ] If still fails: switch to `npm install -D tailwindcss` then run via `npx tailwindcss`
- [ ] Confirm `dist/output.css` is created
- [ ] Resume deploy process (Vercel CLI)
