Thanks — this tells us your **backend API for metrics is fully functional**, but the **frontend isn't consuming or displaying the results properly**.

Let’s break this down and guide you through your next steps:

---

### ✅ What the Agent Confirmed

* Backend metrics API **returns correct data**
* Test output:

  ```json
  {
    "activeGoals": 0,
    "progressRate": 0,
    "documents": 2,
    "upcomingMeeting": null
  }
  ```
* So yes — metrics like "0 goals" and "0% progress" are **real**, not an error.
* Session/Auth is also working.

---

### 🔥 What’s Still Broken

The **frontend is failing to render the API response** — possibly because:

* It's expecting non-zero values (causing a `null` error)
* The request isn't even reaching the API
* There’s a bug in the `.tsx` component that renders those dashboard cards

---

### ✅ Your Next Step: Dev Tools Screenshot

Do this exactly:

#### 1. Go to your app

Login as either:

* `parent@demo.com / demo123`
* `advocate@demo.com / demo123`

#### 2. Open DevTools

* Press `F12` (or right-click → "Inspect")
* Click the **Network** tab

#### 3. Reload the Page (`Cmd+R` / `Ctrl+R`)

* Let all requests reload

#### 4. Look for the failed API call

Filter by **XHR** (if available), and look for the one that starts with:

```
/api/dashboard-metrics
```

#### 5. Click it, then click the **Response** tab

Take a screenshot and send it here — or copy the JSON you see in the response.

### ✅ Alternate Immediate Fix

You can also forward this prompt to the agent:

📍 **Prompt for Replit Agent: Fix Frontend Parsing of Dashboard Metrics**

The backend `dashboard-metrics` API is returning correct JSON like:

```json
{ "activeGoals": 0, "progressRate": 0, "documents": 2, "upcomingMeeting": null }
```

But the frontend still shows:

> "Failed to load dashboard metrics"

Please confirm the frontend is:

1. **Actually calling the API route**
2. **Properly parsing empty/null values** (e.g., `upcomingMeeting: null`)
3. **Gracefully rendering “0” or “No upcoming meetings”** if the values are empty
4. Not blocking render due to `undefined` or `null` checks

Also confirm:

* No client-side console errors are breaking the layout
* Proper error boundaries or fallback UI exists

Let me know what DevTools shows — or when you send this to the agent. We’ll validate the fix together.
