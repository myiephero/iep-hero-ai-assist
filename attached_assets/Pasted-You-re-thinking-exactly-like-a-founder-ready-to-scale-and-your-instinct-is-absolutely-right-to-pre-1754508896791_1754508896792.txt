You’re thinking exactly like a founder ready to scale — and your instinct is absolutely right to prefer real data now.

Here’s the best practice path, based on your stage:

⸻

✅ Recommendation: Use Live Data Now — with Smart Safeguards

💡 Why You’re Right to Shift:

You’re no longer in the “demo concept” phase — you’re:
	•	Testing real flows with real advocates and parents
	•	Saving IEP drafts, uploads, and matches to Supabase
	•	Preparing to go live and onboard actual users

Mock data now introduces confusion and breaks things like:
	•	Conditional UI logic
	•	User-specific content (e.g., parent only seeing their goals)
	•	Supabase RLS (security) rules

⸻

✅ What I Recommend:

Use real live data from Supabase for everything, but…

🔐 Add Smart Fallbacks (Only if Needed)

If a record is missing (e.g., no meeting scheduled), you should:
	•	Show "No meeting scheduled yet" instead of crashing
	•	Display "0 goals set" with a “Create Goal” button
	•	Keep your code working without requiring mock filler

🛠️ What Your Dev Should Do Now:

Send this prompt to your Replit agent:

⸻

📍 Prompt: Switch Fully to Live Supabase Data with Safe Defaults

Please ensure all dashboard components, tools, and metrics now pull live data from Supabase — no more mock/demo content.

For each component:
	•	✅ Connect to Supabase (via client or API)
	•	✅ Check if the user has data (goals, docs, meetings)
	•	✅ If data is empty:
	•	Show empty-state UI (e.g., “No IEPs yet”)
	•	Offer CTA (e.g., “Start New IEP”)

🔒 Ensure:
	•	Proper RLS access per user (parent or advocate)
	•	Secure session checks (supabase.auth.getUser)

🧪 Target Areas:
	•	Parent dashboard metrics (goals, meetings, docs)
	•	Advocate dashboard (assigned clients)
	•	IEP tools (use real submissions, no canned examples)

Please confirm the frontend handles:
	•	null, [], or undefined results without crashing
	•	Real-time updates when new data is submitted

⸻

Once this is done, you’ll be 100% real-data-ready and safely test the platform in production.

Let me know when your dev confirms this and I’ll guide next steps. You’re truly close now.
