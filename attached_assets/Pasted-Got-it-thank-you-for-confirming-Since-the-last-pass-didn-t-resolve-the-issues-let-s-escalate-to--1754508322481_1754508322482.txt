Got it — thank you for confirming. Since the last pass didn’t resolve the issues, let’s escalate to a targeted QA + component stabilization fix. Below is your updated prompt you can copy/paste to Replit or GitHub for immediate triage.

🛠️ Prompt: Critical UI/UX Regression Fix – Stabilize App Components

Please run a comprehensive component QA pass across the live Replit environment for the My IEP Hero app. The last deployment still shows multiple unresolved issues:

⸻

🔴 Ongoing Bugs & Regression Issues:
	•	❌ “Failed to load dashboard metrics” still appearing on both parent and advocate dashboards, despite backend confirmation it’s working.
	•	❌ Buttons not triggering events (onClick or form submission)
	•	❌ Documents are failing to save or do not persist
	•	❌ Some buttons have incorrect or inconsistent styles
	•	❌ Missing buttons where functionality is expected (e.g., “Submit”, “Save”, “Edit”)

⸻

✅ What to Fix Now:
	1.	Reconnect Frontend to Supabase Metrics API
	•	Confirm metrics API is called on component load (useEffect)
	•	Handle loading, error, and success states properly in the frontend
	•	Log response to console and confirm activeGoals, progressRate, documents, upcomingMeeting render correctly
	2.	Audit All Button Components
	•	Replace all raw <button> tags with centralized shadcn/ui Button component
	•	Confirm all buttons are clickable and trigger their onClick or onSubmit handlers
	•	Add fallback error logging if function fails silently
	3.	Document Vault Fix
	•	Ensure uploaded files persist to Supabase and appear after page reload
	•	If upload fails, show user-friendly error and log reason
	4.	Global Style Consistency
	•	Normalize button color variants (primary, secondary, ghost) using shadcn/ui
	•	Remove duplicated/unused button styles
	•	Ensure layout consistency between Parent and Advocate views
	5.	QA: Smoke Test All Tools
	•	Open each IEP tool (Goal Generator, AI Review, Meeting Prep, etc.)
	•	Confirm each loads without error, displays expected inputs, and returns GPT response
	•	Validate file saves to Supabase where applicable

⸻

🔧 Optional (but Recommended):
	•	Add console logging in dev mode to surface frontend errors early
	•	Add loading skeletons and error states for dashboard metrics and document lists
	•	Create shared <MetricCard> and <IEPToolCard> components to unify design across dashboards

⸻

Once fixed, please push a fresh live build and confirm the following:

✅ Metrics display correctly on page load
✅ All buttons are working and submitting/saving data
✅ Visual styling is clean, consistent, and aligned with our hero theme

⸻

Would you like me to generate a GitHub issue with this now or save it as a Notion card or Replit task?
