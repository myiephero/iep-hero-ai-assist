🚨 URGENT REOPEN - QA Regression Report (#61–68)
The following platform-breaking bugs were discovered after redeployment and must be resolved immediately. These are confirmed in production using the QA account rikka6879@yahoo.com with full Hero Plan override.

🔴 CRITICAL ERRORS TO FIX

#61 - Document Vault `.json is not a function` error
Still occurring when sharing or saving documents. Must confirm all Vault actions use `await response.data` not `response.json()`.

#62 - AI Tools: OpenAI Quota Error Not Handled (429)
AI IEP Review and Smart Letter Generator return OpenAI quota errors with no graceful fallback. Must catch 429 errors and show user-friendly UI message.
→ Ref: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors

#63 - JSON Parse Error (`DOCTYPE "<"` ... not valid JSON)
Smart Letter Generator and Advocate Matcher fail on invalid server responses. These are HTML error pages parsed as JSON.
→ Fix: Add `Content-Type` check before parsing, return structured JSON on server errors, improve frontend error boundary.

#64 - Hero Plan Wall Appears on QA Account (Meeting Prep)
QA override failed on `/tools/meeting-prep`. Ensure PlanAware logic includes override check and is wired across all restricted tools.

#65 - Goals Page: `Cannot read property 'filter' of null`
When opening Goals page, platform crashes on null response from `/api/goals`.
→ Fix: add null guard `goals?.filter(...) || []`.

#66 - Advocate Matcher: JSON Parse + Submission Crash
Fails to submit form, backend returns non-JSON, leading to `Unexpected token '<'` crash. Ensure all backend responses are valid JSON, even on error.

#67 - OT Recommender: Student Dropdown Disabled
Student list not loaded in dropdown, despite student existing in dashboard. Re-enable dropdown and confirm `/api/students` populates.

#68 - 404 Error on `/settings`
Settings page link is active, but route not defined. Either remove nav reference or define route properly in router config.

✅ ACTION PLAN

- Refactor apiRequest usage platform-wide
- Add OpenAI error handling (429) to all AI tools
- Patch backend error responses to always return JSON
- Confirm PlanAware override applies to all tools
- Add null guards across `.filter`, `.map`, `.forEach`
- Validate student dropdown hydration logic
- Fix dead route for `/settings`

🛠️ Platform is not stable for QA or production usage until these are resolved. Please confirm receipt and begin triage.
