Not yet — we’ve scoped and built everything for the Advocate Matcher MVP (intake flow, Supabase table, matching logic), but we have not yet sent the implementation task to Replit.

Let’s fix that now.

📝 GitHub Issue or Replit Agent Task: Build Advocate Matcher MVP

Title: 🤝 Build Advocate Matcher MVP (Intake + Supabase + Calendly)

⸻

📌 Summary

We’re ready to launch the Advocate Matcher for Hero Plan parents. This feature connects parents to trained advocates through a guided form and Calendly scheduling. Supabase table (advocate_matches) is already created and ready.

⸻

✅ What Needs to Be Built

1. Add “Find an Advocate” card to Hero Dashboard
	•	Title: Find an Advocate
	•	Description: Get expert help from a trained special education advocate.
	•	Button: Get Matched

⸻

2. Build Intake Form UI (7 Inputs)

Field	Type
Help Needed	Multi-select checkboxes
Biggest Concern	Textarea
IEP Meeting Date	Date picker
Grade Level	Dropdown
School District	Text input
Preferred Contact Method	Radio: Phone / Zoom
Availability	Dropdown or Calendly integration
Upload Docs	Optional file input


⸻

3. Insert Form Data into advocate_matches Supabase Table

Use the following schema:
	•	parent_id (from user session)
	•	submitted_at (now)
	•	meeting_date, contact_method, parent_availability
	•	concerns, help_areas, grade_level, school_district
	•	status default to pending
	•	document_urls (if uploaded)

⸻

4. Show Confirmation Screen After Submit

Display:
	•	Matched Advocate Name (static or dynamic)
	•	Calendly link to schedule call
	•	Meeting instructions or thank you message

⸻

5. (Optional) Auto-send notification to assigned advocate
	•	Email or webhook to Slack/Discord
	•	Include form responses + files

⸻

✅ Goal

Make it easy for Hero Plan users to get matched with a live advocate and book a support call — all within the platform.

Let me know once it’s live so we can test the end-to-end flow.
