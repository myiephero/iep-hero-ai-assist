This error indicates your app is trying to **fetch dashboard metrics**, but the request is **failing**, likely due to one of the following:

---

### 🔎 Likely Causes

1. **No real user data in Supabase yet**

   * If the metrics function relies on data like goals, documents, meetings, etc., and those tables are still empty or use demo placeholders — this will fail.

2. **Backend/API endpoint is broken or unconnected**

   * The `/api/dashboard-metrics` or equivalent endpoint might be throwing an error, missing required headers/auth, or querying non-existent Supabase rows.

3. **Incorrect Supabase connection or query permissions**

   * The Supabase client may not be connected or authorized properly, or RLS (Row Level Security) might be blocking access to needed tables.

4. **Code is referencing mock/demo data that has been disabled**

   * During cleanup, any fallback mock data may have been removed — exposing the broken metrics query now.

📉 **Prompt: Fix "Failed to load dashboard metrics" for Parent & Advocate Dashboards**

Both the Parent and Advocate dashboards are throwing this error:

> "Failed to load dashboard metrics"

Please investigate and fix the following:

### 📊 Metrics Failure – Root Causes to Check

1. **Ensure `/api/dashboard-metrics` (or similar endpoint) is properly connected** to Supabase and querying:

   * `iep_drafts` or `iep_documents`
   * `goals` or `iep_goals`
   * `meetings`
   * `documents`

2. **Fix any Supabase query issues or empty data errors.**

   * Add safe defaults (e.g., return 0 goals if none exist).
   * Prevent app from crashing when no records are returned.

3. **If using Supabase RLS, ensure the logged-in user (parent/advocate) has proper access** to those rows.

4. **Return realistic mock data only if no live records are found** — or flag empty dashboards gracefully.

Once this is fixed, metrics like “Active Goals”, “Progress Rate”, and “Next Meeting” should show live or fallback data correctly for both roles.

Let me know once it’s been submitted and I’ll help you validate the fix or move on to next UI items.
