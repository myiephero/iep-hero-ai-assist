🚀 Prompt for Replit Agent: Add Autism Accommodation Builder to Existing Platform

Hi! I’d like to keep the current My IEP Hero platform as-is and simply add a new module called the Autism Accommodation Builder.

🧠 Integration Instructions:

🔗 New Route:
	•	Add a new page at: /accommodations/autism

🧩 Features to Build:
	1.	Autism Accommodation Form (parent/advocate can fill out):
	•	Child Name
	•	Grade Level
	•	Diagnosis Areas (checkbox list; default to “Autism Spectrum Disorder”)
	•	Sensory Preferences
	•	Behavioral Challenges
	•	Preferred Communication Style
	•	Optional: Free-text notes
	2.	AI-Powered Generation:
	•	Use the OpenAI key from .env
	•	Model: gpt-4o
	•	Prompt structure (I’ll provide this below)
	•	Output: List of accommodations with:
	•	Title
	•	Description
	•	Implementation Suggestions
	•	Category (Sensory, Behavioral, Academic, etc.)
	3.	Display the Results:
	•	Show in a clean, sectioned UI
	•	Include a “Copy” button
	•	Include “Approve” or “Save” if logged-in
	4.	Save Per User (if logged in):
	•	Save accommodation sessions by userId
	•	Allow them to view past sessions
	•	Show “createdBy” role: parent or advocate
	5.	Access Control:
	•	Allow both Parent and Advocate roles
	•	If advocate is logged in, show: “Working for [Parent Name]” at top
	•	Pull current relationships from Supabase if needed
	6.	Upsell Prompt:
	•	If user is on Free plan, show message:
“👋 Want an expert review of these accommodations? Upgrade to the HERO Plan for custom recommendations from a licensed advocate.”

	•	Link to /pricing or Stripe checkout

🤖 OpenAI Prompt Example (use for generation):

You are a special education expert. Based on the inputs below, generate a list of 8 specific IEP accommodations that support a student with autism. Each accommodation should include a title, description, category, and practical classroom implementation details. Use IDEA-compliant language.
	•	Name: Emma Johnson
	•	Grade: 3rd Grade
	•	Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder
	•	Sensory Preferences: Sound sensitivity
	•	Behavioral Challenges: Difficulty with transitions
	•	Communication: Verbal
	•	Notes: Responds well to visuals

⸻

✅ Final Notes:
	•	Use existing backend (Express + MongoDB)
	•	Use current Supabase setup for user/auth/roles
	•	Use same styling and layout as the platform
	•	Let me know if you need a design mockup or exact data models

Thanks! This will be a huge value-add for parents and advocates on our platform! Let me know once it’s live in the nav.

Let me know when you’re ready to generate a design mockup or database schema.
