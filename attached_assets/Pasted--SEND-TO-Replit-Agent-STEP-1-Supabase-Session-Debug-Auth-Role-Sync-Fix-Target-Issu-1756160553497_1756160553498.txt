### 🛠️ [SEND TO: Replit Agent] STEP 1 — Supabase Session Debug + Auth Role Sync Fix  
**Target Issue:** [#82 – Supabase Session False Negative During Auth Hydration](https://github.com/myiephero/iep-hero-ai-assist/issues/82)

---

#### 🧠 Objective:
Diagnose and correct **false negatives during Supabase session hydration**, which result in advocate users being incorrectly routed to the **parent dashboard** due to missing or delayed session detection.

---

#### ✅ Task Scope:

1. Open `_app.tsx` (or wherever `SupabaseProvider` + `AuthProvider` are initialized).
2. Insert precise diagnostic logs **with `[ISSUE-82-STEP-1]` prefix**:
   - `console.debug('[ISSUE-82-STEP-1] Supabase session check START')`
   - `console.debug('[ISSUE-82-STEP-1] Supabase session response:', session)`
   - `console.debug('[ISSUE-82-STEP-1] Supabase client state:', supabase)`
3. Trace the full hydration sequence:
   - Confirm `supabase.auth.getSession()` resolves **before** `getUserRole()` or `getDashboardRoute()` is invoked.
   - Ensure the `AuthContext` is populated **prior to** any role-based dashboard routing logic.
4. Temporarily insert blocking guard (if needed) before routing:
   ```ts
   if (!session || loading) {
     console.debug('[ISSUE-82-STEP-1] Session loading - blocking routing...');
     return <Loading />;
   }
   ```
5. Ensure all race condition logs are visible from `index.js`, `dashboard.tsx`, and `MyParentsPage` where role routing and mount logic occurs.
6. **DO NOT WRAP** `.getSession()` in a generic try/catch — we need raw visibility into the session object.
7. Push to Replit **production** and notify Scott that live testing can begin.

---

#### 🧪 Validation Plan:
- ✅ `[ISSUE-82-STEP-1]` logs appear for all key checkpoints (session load, auth context, routing)
- ✅ Session is no longer `null` or undefined at time of role resolution
- ✅ Advocate user is routed to `/dashboard-advocate` on login

---

#### 🔁 If session is still falsy during routing:
Proceed to Step 2 — patch hydration race by delaying dashboard resolution until Supabase session is fully resolved.
