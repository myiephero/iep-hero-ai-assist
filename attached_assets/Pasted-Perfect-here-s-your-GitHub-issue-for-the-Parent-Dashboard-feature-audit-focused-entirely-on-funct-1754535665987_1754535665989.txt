🧩 Summary

The Parent Dashboard looks visually solid, but critical functional features are broken or missing. This includes issues with document saving, messaging, metrics, and tool interactivity.

⸻

🔍 Current Issues

Feature	Issue	Expected
Dashboard Metrics	Progress rate = 0%, Active Goals = 0, even though data exists	Should reflect real-time goal data
Save to Vault	Still non-functional from Smart Letter Generator	Should insert generated letter into Supabase with auth
Messages	Chat with advocate unresponsive or hidden	Click opens modal or navigates to chat view
Goal Progress	Cannot update % or status from card	Editable via dropdown or modal
Tool Buttons	Many tools (eg. Progress Analyzer) not loading or not interactive	Should navigate to tool or open modals
Document Vault	Cannot preview or edit uploaded docs	Docs should be listed and interactive
Letter Generator	Save/download works inconsistently; Save still fails when logged in	Download + Vault Save must work reliably
No Referral Queue or Timeline	Parents see no IEP journey, next steps, or past meetings	Timeline of actions and IEP events expected
Click actions	No onClick events for tool cards	Should route to /tools/{slug} or show hover action


⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	All dashboard metrics reflect real-time backend data
	•	Smart Letter “Save to Vault” works if parent is logged in
	•	Messages button opens conversation with assigned advocate
	•	Progress bars editable or open goal modal
	•	All tool buttons (Goal Generator, Analyzer, Vault) work
	•	Document Vault displays uploaded docs with preview
	•	Timeline or Recent IEP Activity appears
	•	No dead clicks or broken links on dashboard cards

⸻

🔧 Suggested Debug Path
	1.	Confirm getDashboardMetrics() calls Supabase, not mock
	2.	Check if userId is passed to letter insert endpoint
	3.	Validate tool routes in router config
	4.	Ensure parent role permissions allow all tools
	5.	Use console.debug logs to trace onClick events
	6.	Recheck RLS for document inserts (if re-enabled)

Let me know if you’d like a GitHub version for Vault Save bug, or want to open the Messaging system separately next.
