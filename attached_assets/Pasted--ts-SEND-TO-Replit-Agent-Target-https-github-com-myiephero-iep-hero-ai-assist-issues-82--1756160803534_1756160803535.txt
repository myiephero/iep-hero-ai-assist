Title: 🧭 Supabase Session False Negative During Auth Hydration (Advocate Routed to Parent Dashboard)

🎯 OBJECTIVE: Eliminate edge-case race condition causing false role detection (`parent`) during Supabase session hydration for authenticated `advocate` user.

🔍 CONTEXT:
Even after hydration debug logging (Step 1), user is sometimes routed to `/dashboard-parent` during initial login. Logs show `userRole: parent` followed shortly by `userRole: advocate`. Race condition likely due to parallel invocations of `getUserRole()` and delayed `AuthContext` propagation.

🧪 STEP 2 FIX STRATEGY:
1. ✅ Introduce `useEffect` debounce pattern in `DashboardRouter` to wait for `isHydrated === true` and `userRole !== null` before routing:

useEffect(() => {
  if (isHydrated && userRole && !loading) {
    console.debug('[ISSUE-82-STEP-2] Routing after full hydration:', { userRole });
    const route = getDashboardRoute(userRole);
    router.push(route);
  } else {
    console.debug('[ISSUE-82-STEP-2] Waiting on hydration...', { isHydrated, userRole, loading });
  }
}, [isHydrated, userRole, loading]);

2. ✅ In `getUserRole()`, ensure fallback to "parent" only occurs when all role detection fails:

if (!role && profile?.role) {
  role = profile.role;
}
if (!role) {
  console.warn('[ISSUE-82-STEP-2] Role not found, defaulting to parent (TEMP)');
  role = 'parent'; // TODO: Remove once root cause fixed
}

3. ✅ Do not export userRole until hydration is complete in `useAuth()`:

return isHydrated
  ? { user, userRole, userEmail, isHydrated, loading }
  : { user: null, userRole: null, userEmail: null, isHydrated: false, loading: true };

4. ✅ Add `[ISSUE-82-STEP-2]` debug logs to all routing, fallback, and hydration decision points

5. ✅ Push to Replit production

Expected Result:
✅ Advocates consistently routed to /dashboard-advocate after full hydration  
✅ No misfires to /dashboard-parent  
✅ Logs verify hydration and role before any router.push
