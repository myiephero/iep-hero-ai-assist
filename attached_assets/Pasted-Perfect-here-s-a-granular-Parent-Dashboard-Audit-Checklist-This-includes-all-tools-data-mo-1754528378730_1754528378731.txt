## 🧾 PARENT HERO DASHBOARD: AUDIT CHECKLIST

**Audience:** Replit Agent
**Goal:** Ensure all expected functionality and tools for Hero Plan parents are present, working, styled correctly, and wired to real data.

---

### 🔹 1. Dashboard Metrics

#### Should Appear at Top:

* [ ] **Active Goals** → Number tied to their student
* [ ] **Progress Rate (%)** → Based on actual progress tracking
* [ ] **Next Meeting** → Pulled from IEP dates
* [ ] **Documents** → Count from Supabase `documents` table

#### Current Issues:

* [ ] Many users see `0%` or "Failed to load dashboard metrics"
* [ ] Verify `api/parent/metrics` or equivalent is correctly wired
* [ ] Test with both real and demo users

---

### 🔹 2. Core Tools (Top Grid Buttons)

Expected tools (clean dark boxes with icon + title + subtitle):

* [ ] **Document Vault** – open and view real uploaded docs
* [ ] **Goal Generator** – launches goal-writing form
* [ ] **AI Review** – parses uploaded IEPs
* [ ] **Reports** – generate One-Click Advocacy Reports
* [ ] **Messages** – real-time chat with assigned advocate

All buttons should:

* [ ] Be clickable and functional
* [ ] Match the style of “Document Vault” (not “Use Tool” buttons)
* [ ] Route correctly via `/dashboard-parent`, `/tools/...`

---

### 🔹 3. IEP Overview Panel

#### Title: “Your Child’s IEP Overview”

Should display:

* [ ] Active Goals → count (ex: 3)
* [ ] Overall Progress % → Ex: 75%
* [ ] Next IEP Review Date → Formatted with countdown (e.g., “in 45 days”)
* [ ] Documents → Match Supabase doc count

Check:

* [ ] All values pulling from live data, not mock
* [ ] Fields update when real edits occur

---

### 🔹 4. Recent IEP Activity Feed

Should show:

* [ ] IEP completions
* [ ] Reports generated
* [ ] Advocate messages or meetings
* [ ] Goal updates

Must be:

* [ ] Dynamic (from Supabase)
* [ ] Time-stamped correctly (e.g., “2 days ago”)
* [ ] Accurate per child/student associated with parent

---

### 🔹 5. Additional Tools Section

Should include:

* [ ] Meeting Prep Wizard
* [ ] Letter Generator
* [ ] Progress Logger
* [ ] Get Expert Help

**BUG**:

* [ ] These are often misaligned, inconsistent, or styled like “Use Tool” buttons (should match top grid)
* [ ] Missing tools must be restored

---

### 🔹 6. Button & Navigation Functionality

* [ ] All grid buttons launch corresponding tool modals or route correctly
* [ ] Messages chat loads connected advocate
* [ ] Goals page loads assigned student’s goals
* [ ] Clicking “Create New IEP” starts a fresh document (if enabled)

---

### 🔹 7. Authentication & Role Validation

* [ ] Confirm that [parent@demo.com](mailto:parent@demo.com) is in the `users` table as role = `parent`
* [ ] Ensure Supabase policies allow data to filter by parent ID → student → document/goal

---

### 🔹 8. Error Handling

* [ ] No “Failed to load metrics”
* [ ] If student has no goals or docs, placeholder says “No goals found yet — start with Goal Generator”
* [ ] Missing tool = show fallback or message

---

Once submitted, let me know and we can triage tool-by-tool or move to QA testing.
