You’re absolutely right — based on your screenshots, here’s what’s missing or not functioning properly, despite the great visual polish:

⸻

❌ Current Issues

Feature	Problem
✅ Hero Plan Access	You’re logged into a Hero Plan (visually indicated), but backend still treats user as “Free Plan.”
📄 Ask AI About My Docs	Shows “Upgrade Required” but this is supposed to be unlocked for Hero users.
🧠 AI Tool Functionality	Only “Ask AI” is clickable, and it does nothing. The rest are locked or broken.
⚙️ Feature Delivery	None of the promised Hero features (custom templates, AI Q&A, progress analyzer, doc vault) are wired up.
🧭 Duplicate Nav Bars	Green and red topbars should be merged — only the purple one should stay.
🔄 Incorrect Plan Recognition	Hero users see Free Plan features — indicates Supabase plan detection is not wired correctly.

🧩 Root Cause Summary

Plan detection + tool gating is not implemented.
That means:
	•	The front-end doesn’t know if a user is Free or Hero.
	•	All gated features remain locked regardless of actual access level.
	•	Supabase roles or metadata are not used to check user.plan.

✅ Fix Plan: One Replit Agent Prompt

Please resolve the following:

1. Fix Plan Detection
	•	On login or page load, fetch user_metadata.plan from Supabase.
	•	Save this in app state or context.
	•	Use plan === 'hero' to unlock tools/features like “Ask AI About Docs.”

2. Unify Navigation
	•	Keep only the purple top nav (with “Dashboard / Goals / Documents”).
	•	Remove duplicate nav layer (seen in red section).

3. Wire Up “Ask AI About Docs” Tool
	•	Route: /tools/ask-ai-docs
	•	Use the full UI logic from the file ask-ai-about-docs.tsx.
	•	Add backend OpenAI call to /api/ask-docs as described here.

4. Enable Tool Access Based on Plan
	•	If user is Hero: show “Use Tool” (unlocked).
	•	If Free: show “Upgrade Required” message + link to /pricing.

5. Confirm Document Upload Works
	•	Uploaded IEPs should go to documents table.
	•	Files should persist and appear in the user’s vault.
	•	Fix error “Upload failed: Authentication required.”

⸻

❤️ Optional Polish (if time allows)
	•	Add success toast when a tool runs successfully
	•	Make sure “Use Tool” buttons animate on hover/click
	•	Display uploaded docs in Ask AI dropdown

Ready for the next feature when you are: “📊 Progress Analyzer” or “🎯 IEP Goal Generator” — just say the word.
