# Cloud Run Deployment Guide

## Summary of Applied Fixes

The following fixes have been applied to resolve the Cloud Run deployment error:

### 1. Port Configuration Standardization
- **Problem**: Multiple external ports configured (8080, 5000) causing Cloud Run compatibility issues
- **Solution**: Unified all server configurations to use PORT environment variable, defaulting to 5000
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/index.ts`: Updated to use dynamic PORT from environment
  - `server/minimal.ts`: Enhanced with error handling and PORT environment variable
  - `server-js.js`: Complete rewrite for production deployment

### 2. Error Handling Enhancement
- **Problem**: Demo setup failures blocking deployment startup
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Features Added**:
  - Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
  - Production environment error recovery
  - Port conflict resolution
  - Startup failure prevention

### 3. Production Server Configuration
- **Problem**: No optimized production server configuration
- **Solution**: Created production-ready Express server
- **Features**:
  - Static file serving from `dist/public`
  - Health check endpoint with environment reporting
  - SPA routing support
  - Error middleware

### 4. Container Deployment Support
- **Files Added**:
  - `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build with Node.js 18
  - `cloudbuild.yaml`: Google Cloud Build configuration
  - `.dockerignore`: Optimized container builds

### 5. Cleanup
- **Removed**: Duplicate `iep-hero-ai-assist` directory causing port conflicts
- **Standardized**: All port references to use PORT environment variable

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Direct Cloud Run Deployment
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Use the production server: `node server-js.js`
3. Set PORT environment variable in Cloud Run to 5000

### Option 2: Container Deployment
1. Build Docker image: `docker build -t iep-advocacy-platform .`
2. Deploy to Cloud Run using the container
3. Cloud Run will automatically map port 5000 to port 80

### Environment Variables Required
- `PORT`: Set to Cloud Run's provided port (automatically handled)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
- Database and API keys as configured

## Verification
The production server includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that reports:
- Server status
- Current port
- Environment
- Timestamp

## Key Changes Made
1. **Single External Port**: Now only uses port 5000 (mapped to 80 in Cloud Run)
2. **Environment Variable Support**: Full PORT environment variable handling
3. **Error Recovery**: Production-grade error handling and startup recovery
4. **Static File Serving**: Proper serving of built React application
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling for container environments

These changes ensure compatibility with Cloud Run's single external port requirement and prevent demo setup failures from blocking deployment startup.
