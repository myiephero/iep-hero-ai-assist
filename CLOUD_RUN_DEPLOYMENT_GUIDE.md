# Cloud Run Deployment Fixes Applied

## Summary of Applied Fixes

I've successfully applied all the suggested fixes for your Cloud Run deployment error:

### 1. ✅ Port Configuration Fixed
- **Server now properly binds to 0.0.0.0** for Cloud Run compatibility
- **Single port configuration**: Uses PORT environment variable (defaults to 5000)
- **No conflicting port forwards**: Removed multiple external port configurations

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging for deployment debugging
- **Graceful shutdown** handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT signals required by Cloud Run
- **Uncaught exception handling** prevents silent failures
- **Request logging** for better debugging visibility

### 3. ✅ Health Check Endpoints Added
- **/health**: Basic health check with deployment status
- **/startup-health**: Detailed startup information for Cloud Run verification
- **Container health checks**: Docker health check configured

### 4. ✅ Production Server Configuration
- **Static file serving** from dist/public in production mode
- **SPA routing support** for frontend routes
- **Environment-aware configuration** (development vs production)
- **Proper error middleware** with appropriate error responses

### 5. ✅ Cloud Run Deployment Script
- **deploy-cloud-run.js**: New deployment script optimized for Cloud Run
- **Enhanced Docker configuration**: Updated Dockerfile with proper CMD
- **Cloud Build optimization**: Updated cloudbuild.yaml with proper resource limits

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `server/index.ts`: Enhanced with Cloud Run compatibility, error handling, and logging
- `Dockerfile`: Updated to use new deployment script
- `cloudbuild.yaml`: Added resource limits and proper environment variables

### Created Files:
- `deploy-cloud-run.js`: Cloud Run optimized deployment script
- `CLOUD_RUN_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: This deployment guide

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Docker Container (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t iep-advocacy-platform .

# Run locally to test
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e NODE_ENV=production iep-advocacy-platform

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy iep-advocacy-platform \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/iep-advocacy-platform:latest \
  --region us-central1 \
  --platform managed \
  --port 5000 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 512Mi \
  --cpu 1
```

### Option 2: Google Cloud Build (Automated)
```bash
# Trigger Cloud Build (uses cloudbuild.yaml)
gcloud builds submit --project=YOUR-PROJECT-ID
```

### Option 3: Direct Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Run with Cloud Run script
node deploy-cloud-run.js
```

## Environment Variables for Cloud Run

Set these in your Cloud Run service:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=1`
- `PORT` (automatically set by Cloud Run)

## Health Check Verification

Once deployed, verify the service is working:
- `https://your-service-url/health` - Basic health check
- `https://your-service-url/startup-health` - Detailed startup information

## Key Improvements

1. **Single External Port**: Now only uses one port as required by Cloud Run
2. **Proper Host Binding**: Server binds to 0.0.0.0 for container compatibility
3. **Production Optimized**: Serves static files and handles SPA routing
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and logging
5. **Container Ready**: Optimized Dockerfile with health checks
6. **Resource Efficient**: Proper memory and CPU limits configured

Your deployment should now work correctly with Cloud Run. The server will properly:
- Bind to the correct host and port
- Handle container lifecycle signals
- Serve your built application
- Provide health check endpoints
- Log deployment information for debugging
