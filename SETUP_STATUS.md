# Run Button Configuration Status

## Current Issue
The Run button cannot work because the `.replit` file has syntax errors that prevent Node.js from being installed.

## LSP Errors in .replit
- Invalid run command syntax
- Outdated Nix channel specification

## Files Ready ✅
- `server/index.ts` - Minimal Express server with health checks
- `deploy.js` - Production deployment script
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration present
- `package.json` - Has correct "start" script

## Dependencies Status ✅
- `tsx` - Already installed in node_modules
- `typescript` - Available
- `express` - Available

## To Fix Run Button

### 1. Manual .replit Update Required
Replace your current `.replit` with:
```toml
[run]
command = "npm run start"

[nix]
channel = "stable-24_11"

[env]
NODE_ENV = "development"
PORT = "5000"

[deployment]
run = ["node", "server/index.ts"]
build = "npm run build"
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"

[deployment.env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "5000"
REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT = "1"
```

### 2. After .replit Fix
1. Restart the Repl (environment will reload with Node.js)
2. Click Run - should execute `npm run start`
3. Server will start on port 5000
4. Health check available at `/api/health`

## Test Endpoints Ready
- `GET /` → "My IEP Hero server is running"  
- `GET /api/health` → JSON status response

## Current Blocker
Cannot install Node.js environment due to `.replit` syntax errors.
All code is ready - just need environment configuration fix.
